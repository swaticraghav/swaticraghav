Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Swati Raghav, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating clean and efficient code. I'm experienced in programming languages like Python, Java, and C++, and have a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms, and software design principles.

I believe in the power of technology to change the world, which is why I'm always looking for ways to improve and innovate in my field. Whether it's working on personal projects or contributing to open-source software, I'm always eager to learn and grow as a developer.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading about new technology trends and industry developments, as well as staying active and spending time outdoors. I'm also an advocate for diversity and inclusivity in the tech industry and strive to make a positive impact in everything I do.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you and building something amazing together!
